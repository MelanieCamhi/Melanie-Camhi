			<p>Hi Internet!</p>
			<p>I have returned from my blogging hiatus (I guess that one post really tired me out?). It&#39s been a pretty summer thus far, culminating in my recent return from an incredible Tuscan vacation. I went to Italy really excited to eat squash blossoms, as they&#39re in season and tough to find here (I&#39ve seen them at one farmer&#39s market but they&#39re pricey and haven&#39t looked impressive). I ordered them every time I saw them on a menu and they came fried to perfection in a tempura-like batter and were delicious. So, I tend to think it was nothing short of divine intervention that I returned to find squash blossoms in my first CSA share (PS this is my first CSA, loving it so far, will be blogging a dish made with CSA ingredients each week). Anyway, I told my friend Diana, who I&#39m sharing the CSA share with that squash blossoms were happening the following Sunday and she preceded to invite 2 other friends to share in the fried deliciousness.</p>
			<p>Diana suggested we stuff the blossoms with cheese and who was I to argue? After all, cheese makes everything better. So she looked up a recipe from Giada that used a goat cheese and chive filling and we hit the grocery store. While I started to whisk a beautiful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Classic-Italian-Cooking-Marcella/dp/039458404X">Marcella Hazan</a> batter into submission, Diana, in true Diana fashion, realized that she should have reviewed the ingredients list before we left the grocery store...we needed cream...we had no cream...we improvised. I suppose I can call this an original recipe since the cream was replaced with 2% greek yogurt and skim milk. Who needs authenticity anyway?</p>
			<p>Diana sliced off the top of the blossoms and pried them open while I squeezed the goat cheese stuffing in using a makeshift ziplock pastry bag.</p>

			<p>I quickly dipped the stuffed blossoms into the batter and then hot vegetable oil and in just a few minutes something magical happened...</p>

			<p>Finished them off with a sprinkle of sea salt and went at it. Internet, these were good, like really good. So good that I momentarily felt bad when Misha came over for dinner the next night and asked if there were any left. Psh, fool was invited, he should've known better! Ok Internet, I'll be back soon (promise)!</p>

			<p>Dear Internet,</p>
			<p>So, for my inaugural entry, I decided to try something that has been on the list for ages: homemade sushi. Once I saw <a href="https://food52.com/recipes/28165-vegan-sushi">this great post </a>on how simple it is to make, I decided it was time.</p>
			<p>I ran out and got nori/seaweed, sushi rice (fun little fact- other rices will not work, glad I checked that before starting) and a bamboo mat ($1.99 at World Market, oh yeah!) and got to work following the instructions on how to prepare the rice.</p>
			<p>We decided to go with an awe inspired cucumber and avocado roll, as I was not quite ready to invest the money or the schlep in buying sushi-grade fish while I estimated a 50/50 shot at this being a total disaster.</p>
				<img class="photo" src="Food/2014-05-18 19.07.29 copy.jpg">
			<p>Also made <a href="https://food52.com/recipes/28005-pickled-ginger">pickled ginger</a>, which turned out really well.</p>
				<img class="photo" src="Food/2014-05-18 19.20.26 copy.jpg">
			<p>Not so coincidentally, sushi happens to be Misha&#39s favorite food. Misha is quite helpful, so I keep him around.</p>
				<img class="photo"src="Food/2014-05-18 19.09.27 copy.jpg">
			<p>Misha&#39s verdict: &quotNot bad for a first try... so we can make this again right?&quot</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, see below for rounds 2-3...</p>
				<img class="photo"src="Food/2014-05-18 19.57.12 copy.jpg">
			<p>I&#39ll say a promising first attempt, with plenty of room for improvement.</p>
			<p>Ok Internet, you&#39ve been great! See you again the next time I get hungry (so let&#39s say in around 30 minutes or so)...</p>
